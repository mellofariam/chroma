# `chroma`: Chromosome Analysis toolkit

This is just a collection of the scripts I used in my own research.

These functions were designed to analyze chromosome simulations using [OpenMiChroM](https://github.com/junioreif/OpenMiChroM).

After cloning the repository, one should be able to install by running

```pip install -e chroma```
